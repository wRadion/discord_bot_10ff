Only local connections are allowed.

### Database Migrations

This project uses *sqlite* as a database, and the *sequel* gem as the Ruby API.

Create your migration in `db/migrate/`.
[Here is some help](https://github.com/jeremyevans/sequel/blob/master/doc/migration.rdoc) if you don't know how to write a Sequel migration.

The file **must** be following this format: `XXX_<name>.rb`.
Where `XXX` is a 3 digits numbers, and must be the one following the last number present in the folder.

Example: if you see a file named `023_create_users.rb`, your next migration **must** be called `024_<something>.rb`.

Then, just run the shell script in `scripts/`:

```
$ ./scripts/migrate
```

### Ruby console

You can start a Ruby console with everything setup using the following shell scripts:

```
$ ./scripts/console
```
